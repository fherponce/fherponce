## Hello my name is Fernanda Ponce👋
✈️ I have a Bachelor's Degree in Gastronomy, and more than 10 years of professional experience in customer service, hospitality, and staff training, however I wanted a change and looking to challenge myself I decided for a switch to technology. 

💻 Recently I graduated from a bootcamp of Data Analysys with Tripleten. 

🔭 I’m currently looking for a job as a data analyst, so allow me to help with your company analysis taking advantage of my people skills.
